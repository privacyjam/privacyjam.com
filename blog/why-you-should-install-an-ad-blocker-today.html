    <h2>Why You Should Install an Ad Blocker Today</h2>
    <p style="opacity: 0.6; margin-top: -0.5em;">April 10, 2025</p>

    <p>An Adblocker is a simple extension you add to your browser, and it blocks trackers, ads, and minimizes tracking that companies such as Google, Facebook (Meta), and others can do.</p>
    <p>My favorite Adblocker is uBlock origin, it starts blocking ads right as you install it!</p>
    <p>Installing one is as simple as just 3 clicks! From here select your browser and click something along the lines of 'Install' or 'Add'.</p>
    <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a><br>
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a><br>
    <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin-lite/cimighlppcgcoapaliogpjjdehbnofhn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edge</a><br>
    <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opera</a>

    <p>Firefox for example</p>

    <p>And thats all, it will instantly start blocking ads and trackers, if you want to configure it you can do so by doing these steps.</p>
    <p>In your browser click on it</p>
    <img src="../blog/assets/images/why-you-should-install-an-ad-blocker-today/1.png" alt="Image showing the uBlock origin extension in Firefox" />
    <p>Clicking it will open up a menu, this is where you can turn off uBlock if a website every breaks by clicking that big blue power button.</p>
    <p>In the bottom right click the settings icon.</p>
    <img src="../blog/assets/images/why-you-should-install-an-ad-blocker-today/2.png" alt="Image showing the uBlock origin extension menu in Firefox" />
    <p>You will be brought to the advanced menu, on the top bar, click 'Filter Lists'</p>
    <img src="../blog/assets/images/why-you-should-install-an-ad-blocker-today/3.png" alt="Image showing the uBlock origin advanced extension top menu in Firefox, showing only 3 items" />
    <p>Upon clicking, you will see the panel where you can enable, and disable filters. The built in ones are great, but if you want to enable more you can by clicking the checkbox next to one.</p>

    <p><strong>Great job</strong>! You have now improved your resistance against tracking online in just a few clicks!</p>
